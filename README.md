# nalu_abl_postprocess
Some post processing scripts specific to Nalu ABL cases


1. Read, store and plot the mean velocity, temperature and variance profiles generated by the ABLPostProcessing class in Nalu
2. Read the plane data generated through realm transfers, calculate, store and plot the 2-D spectra at the different planes.
3. Calculate the height of the capping inversion and Monin-Obukhov length scale based on the statistics calculated earlier.
